## The topic that we are working on is Agrotechnology **(KRISHICULTURE)**

### The problem statement:- 
##### Recently our team was going through the problems faced by farmers because we recently realised that a farmers son does not want to be a farmer but be a doctor or engineer. 
While scrolling through google cloud we encountered a website called AgroStar. 
As AgroStar was a good initiative we decided to extend the same website and hence the birth of our website __“KRISHICULTURE”__. AgroStar focuses on the input part of the farmers whereas KRISHICULTURE extends this to the output perspective of farmers. The population of India and the world is rapidly increasing, and soon we all will be facing food sarcacity. Artificial food is being processed and it won’t be surprising if we do not get any natural food in the future. 
In 2017, the government was struggling to keep the prices of essential vegetable affordable as retail prices crossed Rs 60/- per kg.  Then Union Food Minister had expressed his helplessness in controlling onion prices and blamed reduction in the area of cultivation and hoarding by traders for the shortage. The government was forced to take measures such as procuring onions from local markets and discouraging exports to bring the prices down. In order to keep a watch on the hoarders, the government has roped in various agencies to keep a check on the hoarding activities over the period of time. Also, with predictions of a ""below average"" monsoon in the year 2019, the Central government asked procurement agencies to store at least 50,000 tons of onions to ensure that market prices remain under control in case of shortage. The buffer stock would be used to control prices in case there is a shortage of onions in the market. Fluctuating weather and decreasing monsoon, causes decrease in crop (onion) output which in turn creates a demand supply gap hence leading to increase in prices or inflation.
Unseasonal rains all over the country have ruined vegetable crops and disrupted market operations, creating a shortage. High diesel prices too have added to the woes of consumers as they bear the increased transport costs. The crash and spurt in prices of these essential veggies has unfortunately become an acceptable cycle.



### Our Proposed Solution:-
#### This is what our website consists of:- 
We are primarily focusing on:- 
Giving the farmers the current updated market scenario ( including GDP, taxes and the market demand).
Giving accurate weather forecasts to ensure good crop production.
Giving the nearest wear house details and the stock details to the farmers.
Promoting the schemes announced by the central government and providing the necessary details and links for the same


### Future Prospective:-
1. We can use IR technology to detect the plant disease at a very early stage. This technology uses the temperature spectrum in analysing the crop. The temperature difference causd by transpiration helps the farmer in knowing if the crop is affectd or not at a very early stage. 
This will ensure good and healthy crop production
2. We can also try to eliminate all the middle men and just have the government intervenene to regulate the taxes and prices of the crops. This will remove all the additional costs on the products available in the market.
